### Our group name is PartyGroup6 and our robot's name is officially Partybot, but also named Jerry-Bob.

We would like the bot to pick up a can/cans of soda and deliver it to party guests. It would also have storage for a speaker to play music, and a bowl holder (maybe with a dip holder too) on top for bowls of chips, veggies, and other snacks. It will be moblie, with a rectangualr base.
