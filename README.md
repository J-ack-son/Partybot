## Our Team:# Partygroup6

## Our Team:
* Jackson - Team Leader, Advisor, Programmer
* Xander - Strategist, Mechanical Engineer
* Preston - Driver, Safety Captain, scouting lead
* Landon- Cad Designer, Electrical Engineer, Documentation Specialist

  
#### Not Competition Minded so we don't need a Public Relations or a scouting lead.

### Our group name is PartyGroup6 and our robot's name is officially Partybot, but also Jerry-Bob.

We want the bot to pick up cans of soda and deliver them to party guests. It would also have storage for a speaker to play music, and a bowl holder (maybe with a dip holder too) on top for bowls of chips, veggies, and other snacks. It will be mobile and have a rectangular base.
