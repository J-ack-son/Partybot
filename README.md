# Our Team: Partygroup6

### Our robot's name is Partybot. He likes to party.

We want the bot to pick up cans of soda and deliver them to party guests. It will acomplish this using a claw attatched to a vetical elevator. A rotating base for the elevator will rotate the can then,using the elevator agian, lower the can into a cup holder. It would also have storage for a speaker to play music which would just be some space on the bottom layer for a small, (non-vex) bluetooth speaker. And finallay a bowl holder (maybe with a dip holder too) on top for bowls of chips, veggies, and other snacks, which will be a Perfectly designed rectangualar structure with precise measurements to hold a dome shaped bowl.
It will be mobile and have a rectangular base.

###### Summary of the features of the robot:
* Claw to grab cans
* Elevator to store cans
* Storage for Speaker
* Retangular structure to hold a domed-shaped bowl
