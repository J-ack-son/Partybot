# Our Team: Partygroup6

### Our robot's name is Partybot. He likes to party.

We want the bot to pick up cans of soda and deliver them to party guests. It will acomplish this using a claw attatched to a vetical elevator. A rotating base for the elevator will rotate the can then,using the elevator agian, lower the can into a cup holder. It would also have storage for a speaker to play music which would just be some space on the bottom layer for a small, (non-vex) bluetooth speaker. And finallay a bowl holder (maybe with a dip holder too) on top for bowls of chips, veggies, and other snacks, which will be a Perfectly designed rectangualar structure with precise measurements to hold a dome shaped bowl.
It will be mobile and have a rectangular base.

###### Summary of the features of the robot:
* Claw to grab cans
* Elevator to store cans
* Storage for Speaker
* Retangular structure to hold a domed-shaped bowl

## Our Team:
### Jackson:  Team Leader, Advisor, Programmer, aids with everything else too
* Oversees the entire team and ensures that all tasks are on track.
* Writes and tests the code that controls the robot.
* Provides guidance and expertise in engineering, programming, and project management.
* Designs and builds the robot’s physical structure.
* Manages wiring, sensors, and power distribution.
### Xander: Strategist, Mechanical Engineer, aided with CAD design
* Designs and builds the robot’s physical structure.
* Collaborates with the CAD designer to turn designs into reality.
* Creates detailed computer-aided design (CAD) models of the robot.
* Develops the overall competition strategy.(in this case stategy for building the robot to execute the tasks provided.
### Preston: Driver, Safety Captain, aided with mechanical
* Operates the robot during competitions. (Or in our case, just for testing)
* Ensures that all team members follow safety protocols.
* Works on the drivetrain, chassis, and any mechanical systems (e.g., arms, lifts, grippers).
* Ensures that the robot meets size, weight, and functional requirements.
### Landon: Cad Designer, Electrical Engineer, Documentation Specialist
* Creates detailed computer-aided design (CAD) models of the robot.
* Designs and assembles the robot’s electrical systems.
* Troubleshoots electrical issues during testing.
* Keeps detailed records of the design process, decisions, and progress.
  
We are not Competition Minded so we don't need a Public Relations or a scouting lead.
